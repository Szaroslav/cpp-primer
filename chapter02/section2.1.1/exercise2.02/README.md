# Section 2.1.1 _Arithmetic types_

## Exercise 2.02

> To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

I would use `float` or `double` floating-point type. Single-precision is more than fine in this case, `double` can be faster to do some computations.
