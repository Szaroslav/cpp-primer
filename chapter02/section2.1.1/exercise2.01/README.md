# Section 2.1.1 _Arithmetic types_

## Exercise 2.01

> What are the differences between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short`? Between an `unsigned` and a `signed` type? Between a `float` and a `double`?

#### Integral types:
The `short`, `int`, `long` and `long long` are integral types, the difference between them is their memory size. `short` is theoretically the smallest, `long long` the largest.

#### Signed and unsigned types:
`signed` number can be negative, `unsigned` must be greater or equal than 0.

#### Floting-point types:
The `float` is a single-precision floating-point type, the `double` is (_as the name suggests_) double-precision. What does it mean? It means `double` variable is more precise.
