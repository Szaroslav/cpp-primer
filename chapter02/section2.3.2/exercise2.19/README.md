# Section 2.3.2 _Pointers_

## Exercise 2.19

> Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

- Reference cannot be rebinded, pointer can.
- Reference is not an object, it's an alias.
- Pointer may not be initialized.
- To access a value of object, which a pointer points to, it's neccessary to use dereference operator `*`.
- Pointers may be `void *` type, which means that this kind of pointer points to any type.
