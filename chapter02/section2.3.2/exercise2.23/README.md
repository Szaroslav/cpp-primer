# Section 2.3.2 _Pointers_

## Exercise 2.23

> Given a pointer `p`, can you determine whether `p` points to a valid object? If so, how? If not, why not?

It isn't possible to check, whether pointer `p` points to a valid object. Pointers store address of memory, whenever we rid of that part of memory, pointers still point to that place.
