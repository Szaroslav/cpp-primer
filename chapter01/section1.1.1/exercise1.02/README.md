# Section 1.1.1 _Compiling and executing our program_

## Exercise 1.02
> Change the program to return `-1`. A return value of `-1` is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from `main`.

`main.cpp`
```cpp
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```
