# Section 1.4.2 _The_ `for` _statement_

## Exercise 1.12

> What does the following `for` loop do? What is the final value of sum?
> ```cpp
> int sum = 0;
> // Single statement block, curly brackets are not necessary
> for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i)
>   sum += i;
> ```

Above the `for` loop sums numbers from -100 to 100, the final value of sum is 0.
