## Exercise 1.6

> Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
> ```cpp
> std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
>           << " and " << v2;
>           << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
> ```
> If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?
