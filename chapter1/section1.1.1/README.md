# 1.1.1 Compiling and Executing Our Program
## Exercises section 1.1.1

### Exercise 1.1
Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file
naming convention it uses. Compile and run the `main` program from page 2.

### Exercise 1.2
Change the program to return `-1`. A return value of `-1` is often treated
as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from `main`.
